# Minimalist URL shortener
This is a minimalist URL shortener prototype, with no data persistence. It uses [nanoid](https://github.com/ai/nanoid) to generate the short hashes and [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) framework to serve the http API and the web ui.

## How to run?

Install the dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

Start the sever:
```bash
yarn start
# or
npm run start
```
Then you can access the app at: http://localhost:3004/
